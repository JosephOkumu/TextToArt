# Project Text-To-Art

This project takes text input from command-line arguments, and prints out its ASCII-Art graphical representation in the terminal.



## Documentation

This part contains instructions on how to make use of our program.

### Usage

To use this program, you need to have the latest version of Go installed in your system.
After cloning the projects repository, navigate to the asciiart directory and execute the following command in your terminal.
```bash
go run main.go "Hello, World!"
```
Replace "Hello, World!" with the string you want to print in the terminal.

Our program can handle one or multiple command line argument strings, and also prints new-line characters as expected. For example:
```bash
go run main.go Hello, World!
```
and,
```bash
go run main.go "Hello,
> World!"
```
